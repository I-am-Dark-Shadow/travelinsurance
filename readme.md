## Destination Dropdown Rules

### Users can select each destination only once
If a destination (e.g. *Bali*) is selected multiple times, only a **single chip** is added.

### Remove destination using close button
Clicking the close (×) button on a chip removes that destination from the selected list.

### Empty state handling
If the destination search returns no results, an empty state message is displayed:
> **"Destination not found"**

### Keyboard Accessible Dropdown
The dropdown is fully keyboard accessible:
- **Arrow Down / Arrow Up** → Navigate options
- **Enter** → Select destination
- **Escape** → Close dropdown
